                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Orders may be placed exclusively online at the Website of the TAKEOFF Sagl  which is available in English, Italian, German  and French languages. <br> 

                            Purchase orders for products on the Website (“Order”) are placed according to the following online purchase procedure: <br>

                            The Client searches for  the certain product(s) of interest at the website. The  details about the product(s)  can be found in the product sheet published on the Website;<br>
                            The Client selects the product (s) of interest and adds it (them) to the shopping cart. At that stage, the Client can decide to continue shopping or proceed to checkout;<br>
                            Clients who have a specific coupon code can enter the code in the “Apply coupon” field (exactly as shown, without spaces). After that, clicking on “Update cart” should display the adjusted price;<br>
                            In order to finalize the purchase, the Client clicks on “Go to checkout”;
                            Before placing the order, the Client may review and change the order related data at any time in the shopping cart area of the Website. The Buyer may identify and correct input errors at any time, before finally submitting the order by clicking the “proceed to payment” button, by reviewing the order and the price, reviewing the details of each product and selecting or deselecting a product.<br>
                            At the checkout stage, the Client has an opportunity to either register at the Website or to sign in (for already registered clients), or checkout as a guest.<br>
                            The Client then selects a payment method:
                                            Credit or debit card (Visa, Visa Electron, MasterCard etc.) PayPal; through online payment software Stripe (http://stripe.com) <br>

                                            Apple or GooglePay <br>

                            Finally, the Client confirms the Order by clicking the appropriate button on the Website.<br>
                            The personal information supplied by the Client during checkout must be accurate and up to date. TAKEOFF Sagl  disclaims all liability for issuing incorrect tax documents due to inaccurate or incomplete data provided by the Client. <br>

                            Orders placed by clicking the “Place my order” button by the Client constitute a binding offer to us to enter into a purchase agreement.  <br>

                            We will send you a receipt of your order via email immediately after your submission including the details of your order. This receipt of your order does not constitute an acceptance of your offer. <br>

                            The Order is not deemed to be accepted until the Client receives the confirmation of acceptance of the Order (“Order Confirmation”), which generally coincides with the date of dispatch of the products ordered. Thus, the contract of sale for the products between TAKEOFF Sagl  and the Client must not be considered perfected until such date. <br>

                            A contract of sale will only be concluded when the ordered product(s) are dispatched to the Client and a shipping confirmation is sent to the Client’s registered email address.  <br>

                            The contract of sale will not be concluded for products not listed in the shipping confirmation.  <br>

                            However, orders may be placed and transmitted only if the Client accepts these Terms and Conditions by placing a checkmark in the appropriate check box, thereby including them into his/her offer.  <br>

                            For modification of an Order, the Client may contact the Seller by email at support@domocosmetics.shop Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Order can no longer be canceled or modified once it has been indicated on the Website as “In preparation for shipping”. <br>

                            TAKEOFF Sagl  is not able to determine the amount of such import charges in advance or to provide the Client with any advice in that respect. <br>

                            Any changes in the prices of the products will enter into effect on the date of publication of the new prices on the Website, with no retroactive effects on the Orders already accepted by sending the Order Confirmation. <br>

                            TAKEOFF Sagl  reserves the right not to accept an Order because the product prices are incorrect, including in the Order displayed on the Website or indicated in the email sent to confirm receipt of the Order. <br>

                            An Order can be sent in several packages for logistical reasons. The Client is requested to check his email box for messages in which TAKEOFF Sagl  declared that one or more items would be sent separately. In case of presumed discrepancies between the amount ordered and the amount received, the Client may contact Customer Service by sending an e-mail to support@domocosmetics.shop <br>

                            Debit and credit cards (belonging to the Visa, Visa Electron, Mastercard);<br>
                            PayPal;<br>

                            TAKEOFF Sagl  neither possesses nor processes in any way data related to the methods of payment chosen by the Client. <br>

                            Please note that in case a credit/debit card is used, the credit/debit card information is managed directly by banking institutions and/or companies specializing in payment management, by means that are entirely secure for the Client. <br>

                            If it is suspected that a payment method is being used in a problematic and/or irregular manner, TAKEOFF Sagl  may verify that the payment method in question is used in a legitimate and proper manner. If irregularities are found, TAKEOFF Sagl  will not continue processing the Order and will inform the Client thereof. <br>

                            In case an Order is canceled or withdrawn or any in any other case involving a price refund to the Client, the reimbursement can only be made using the payment method that was used to complete the Order. <br>

                            TAKEOFF Sagl  shall provide for delivery of the Order via a first-rate forwarding agent.<br>

                            While it is our practice to confirm orders by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service. We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service to any customer. We also may require verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.<br>

                            To provide the Client more complete and dedicated service, under certain circumstances TAKEOFF Sagl  may, with the Client’s consent, allow the forwarding agent to contact the Client to arrange for a delivery date more convenient to the Client. If the Client supplies his own telephone number, the forwarding agent that offers such a service shall contact the Client directly from the appropriate subsidiary upon arrival of the package intended for delivery.<br>

                            Any Client desiring to make use of said service, where available, is asked to specify his own telephone number in the checkout phase, in which case the shipping times will depend on the agreements between the Client and forwarding agent. Otherwise, the shipping times shall be as indicated above.<br>

                            If unable to deliver the Order within the above-specified times, TAKEOFF Sagl  shall give the Client timely notice thereof by e-mail and/or telephone, indicating the time required to complete the Order.<br>

                            The Client is asked to undertake to facilitate the delivery of the Order by making himself available to take delivery of the Order or by delegating that task to third parties.<br>

                            If the forwarding agent does not succeed in delivering the Order, Customer Service shall contact the Client to check whether he is interested in another shipping.<br>

                            TAKEOFF Sagl  cannot be held liable for any delays that are not attributable to its own faults or negligence. For example, TAKEOFF Sagl  shall be considered exempt from any liability for delays resulting from customs procedures, strikes, natural disasters, force majeure or any other circumstance beyond its control.<br>

                            At the time of delivery of the Order, the Client shall check for the right number of packages and the integrity of the outer packing.<br>

                            If the Client finds any irregularities in the delivery, for example regarding the number of packages or damage to the outer packing, the Client shall sign the delivery documents with reservations and contact Customer Service. If the Client deviates from said procedure, the Client may not raise any objections to the delivery, without prejudice to such objections as are provided by law in case of hidden defects and according to the applicable customer protection laws and regulations.<br>

                            *Due to the current situation and the high volume of orders, please note that your delivery may be delayed by 1 to 2 working days. We will do our best to ensure that you receive your order as soon as possible.<br>

                        <p>
                            TAKEOFF Sagl  guarantees the Client that the products sold are not defective and fully comply with all the provisions of the contract of sale. <br>

                            TAKEOFF Sagl  undertakes to ensure that the products: <br>

                            correspond with the description given on the Website and have the qualities of the products that TAKEOFF Sagl  has presented to the Client as a sample or model;<br>
                            are fit for the purpose for which products of the same type are normally used;<br>
                            have the usual quality and efficacy that the Client may reasonably expect of a product of the same type, taking the nature of the product into account.<br>
                            For technological reasons, TAKEOFF Sagl  cannot guarantee that the display of colors on the screen is always accurate. <br>

                            Marginal differences between the description of a product on the Website and the actual characteristics of the product shall not be considered a cause of non-conformity of the product. <br>

                            The guarantee of conformity of the products sold on the Website shall remain in effect for a period of 2 (two) years after the date of receipt of the products by the Client. <br>

                            In case of delivery of a non-conforming product, the Client may demand that the products be brought into conformity, at no extra charge, through repair or replacement or else, if it is impossible to do so, the Client shall be entitled to an appropriate reduction of the purchase price or to a refund of the purchase price and of the shipping fees (if actually incurred). <br>

                            The Client shall notify TAKEOFF Sagl  of any non-conformity of the products within a period of 2 (two) months after the date of detection of the non-conformity by sending an email to support@donocosmetics.shop <br>

                            The mere receipt of the products by TAKEOFF Sagl  after the present procedure has been initiated by no means constitutes an acknowledgement of any non-conformity of the products, since careful verification by TAKEOFF Sagl  is required to that purpose. <br>

                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            The Client is entitled to cancel the present Terms of Sale within 14 (fourteen) days after the date of delivery of the products. Without prejudice to the causes of exclusion indicated above, and to the extent permitted by law, the Client may, in fact, return the products without providing any justification or incurring any penalty whatsoever. <br>

                            If the Client decides to exercise the right of cancellation, the Client shall notify TAKEOFF Sagl  of that decision according to the instructions provided by TAKEOFF Sagl . <br>

                            The Client shall be responsible for ensuring the return transportation of the products to TAKEOFF Sagl . If the transport is arranged by the Client, then the right of cancellation shall be forfeited if the products to be returned are lost or stolen during transport to the warehouses of TAKEOFF Sagl . <br>

                            The Client shall deliver the products, without undue delay, to the forwarding agent for return, in any case within fourteen days after the Client notified TAKEOFF Sagl , in the prescribed manner, of the Client’s decision to cancel the contract. <br>

                            If the Client makes use of the right of cancellation, the Client shall give TAKEOFF Sagl  prior notice thereof by sending cancellation form an email to support@domocosmetics.shop <br>

                            Client’s returns should be sent to the following address: <br>

                            After the Client’s legitimate exercise of the right of cancellation, TAKEOFF Sagl  shall proceed to reimburse the Client for the purchase price of the products and initial delivery fees, but not for the shipping fees for the return of the products. <br>

                            TAKEOFF Sagl  shall proceed to reimburse the Client without undue delay, at the latest within 14 (fourteen) days after the date of delivery of the returned products to TAKEOFF Sagl  or else within 14 (fourteen) days after the date on which the Client provides TAKEOFF Sagl  with suitable proof that all the products involved in the cancellation have been shipped, whichever date comes first. <br>

                            The price of the Order shall be reimbursed through the same payment method as was used by the Client for the purchase. <br>

                            In any case, the Client shall return the entire product in its original packing and, in any case, not opened or used. <br>

                            The Client hereby acknowledges that the right of cancellation cannot be exercised if the products supplied are: <br>

                            products that are made to order or clearly customized; <br>
                            products at risk of rapid deterioration or expiry;<br>
                            sealed products that are unsuitable for return for reasons of hygiene or health protection or because they have been opened after delivery; <br>
                            products that, after delivery, are, by nature, inseparably mixed with other products;<br>
                            If, in the course of verifying the legitimacy of the cancellation, TAKEOFF Sagl  ascertains that the Client’s right of cancellation has been forfeited, TAKEOFF Sagl  shall return the product to the Client only if the Client agrees to assume the related shipping fees. TAKEOFF Sagl’s mere acceptance of products returned for the purpose of checking the condition of the same products by no means constitutes an acknowledgement of the legitimacy of the Client’s exercise of the right of cancellation. <br>
